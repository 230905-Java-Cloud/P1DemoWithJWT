    /* WHAT are fetch and cascade?

    fetch - sets whether the dependency (Role) is eagerly or lazily loaded
    (typically we want eager loading so the relationship is ready whenever we need it)

    cascade - sets how changes in a table CASCADE to dependent records
    (with CascadeType.ALL, if a Role is updated/deleted, that operation will cascade to any Employees) */
